# Train Models
 This project aims to build and train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These models are evaluated based on four key performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. The objective is to compare the effectiveness of each model in solving a classification problem. This project solves the problem of model selection for classification tasks by using different algorithms and evaluating their performance to determine the most suitable one for a given dataset.
